          <div>Dance Project opinion</h3>
            <p>I did this project in the beginning of the program. I just started learing on scratch and was getting to know the tools. It was a little
              difficult at first, but within the time it got easier to use. Scratch was like a base to learning program because in python it became more
            challening, and you needed to know the functions in order to get the program started.</p>
